# NFC-Clock-Project

NFCClock is an alarm clock application for Android.

The only difference with a classic alarm clock app is for turning off the alarm, you have to use an NFC tag witch you have registered first.

That means you put the tag away from your bed, and in the morning you must get up to turn off your phone.

It's looking a lot like the Clock app from the original Android (and it's wanted). But I rewrote everything by myself (Except one class from https://gist.github.com/quanturium/c8aa0599a3f984036525)

This app isn't finished yet.
I will work on it very soon to put it on the Play Store.
