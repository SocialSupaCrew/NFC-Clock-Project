# NFC-Clock-Project

NFCClock is an alarm clock application for Android.

The only diference with a classic alarm clock app is for turning of the alarm, you have to use a NFC tag witch you have registered first.

That mean you put the tag away from your bed, and in the morning you must get up to turn off your phone.

It's look a lot like the Clock app from the original Android (and it's wanted). But I rewrote everything by myself (Exept one class from https://gist.github.com/quanturium/c8aa0599a3f984036525)

This app isn't finished yet.
I will work on it very soon to put it on the Play Store.
